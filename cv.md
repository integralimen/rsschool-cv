## About me
I'm a highly promising, creative and imaginative person, fascinated by the aesthetick of code and the very idea that you can talk to machines - and actually see how your commands work. I want to grow in the field of web dewolopment and have already completed three full Python tasks on [exercism.org](https://exercism.org) (which I'm pretty proud of, honestly).

## Code Example
```python
"""Functions for implementing the rules of the classic arcade game Pac-Man."""
def eat_ghost(power_pellet_active, touching_ghost):
    """Return True if Pac-Man can eat the ghost"""
    return power_pellet_active and touching_ghost
def score(touching_power_pellet, touching_dot):
    """Return True if Pac-Man scored"""
    return touching_power_pellet or touching_dot
def lose(power_pellet_active, touching_ghost):
    """Return True if Pac-Mam loses (no pallet + ghost touch)."""
    return touching_ghost and not power_pellet_active
def win(has_eaten_all_dots, power_pellet_active, touching_ghost):
    """Return True if all dots are eaten, i.e. player wins."""
    return has_eaten_all_dots and (not touching_ghost or power_pellet_active)
```
